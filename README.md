# CS2 Autoexec Installation Guide

Enhance your Counter-Strike 2 experience with this pre-made autoexec configuration, designed to optimize your settings and provide useful features like script management. Follow these simple steps to install and setup the autoexec:

**üìÇ Step 0: Downloading and Extracting the Files üìÇ**

1. Navigate to the GitHub repository containing the autoexec files.
2. Click on the green "Code" button and select "Download ZIP".
3. Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a location of your choice. This will create a folder containing the necessary files. For CS2 you want the contents inside the CS2 folder.
   
**Note:** CSGO and my autoexec for it is now deprciated and is only here for legacy reasons.
   
**üìÇ Step 1: Locate Your CS2 CFG Folder üìÇ**

The CS2 CFG folder is where you'll place the autoexec files. You can find it using either of these methods:

* **Default Location:**
  ```
  Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\cfg
.  ```
* **Through Steam:**
  1. Open your Steam Library.
  2. Right-click on Counter-Strike 2.
  3. Select "Properties".
  4. Click on the "Local Files" tab.
  5. Click "Browse". This will open the game's installation folder, and the `cfg` folder will be inside.

**üìÇ Step 2: Copy and Paste the Files üìÇ**

1. Download the provided `autoexec.cfg` file and the `AFK` folder.
2. Navigate to your CS2 CFG folder.
3. Copy and paste both the `autoexec.cfg` file and the `AFK` folder into this folder.
4. Feel free to explore and edit the files within the `AFK` folder to customize your AFK settings.

**‚öôÔ∏è Step 3: Enable the Developer Console & Add Launch Options ‚öôÔ∏è**

1. Open your Steam Library.
2. Right-click on Counter-Strike 2.

   ```
6. Click "OK".

**‚öôÔ∏è Step 4 (Optional): Rebind the Console Key ‚öôÔ∏è**

If your keyboard doesn't have a tilde (~) key or you prefer a different key for the console, you can rebind it through the in-game settings:

1. Launch CS2.
2. Go to "Settings" (gear icon).
3. Navigate to the "Keyboard / Mouse" tab.
4. Scroll down to "Developer Console" and click on the keybind.
5. Press your desired key to rebind it.

1. Launch CS2.
2. Open the developer console using your newly bound key or the tilde (~) key.
3. In the console, type:
   ```
   exec autoexec
   ```
4. Press Enter.
